# art3xias23's Personal Profile

### Intro 

Hiya, in this profile you'll find me following tutorials, experimenting with new languages, frameworks and developing some projects which are of use to me or I'm passionate about.

### Nowadays
Currently spending as much time as necessary developing a blog where I wish to post about problems I've solved, how I've solved them. I'm relatively young at css, so I'm taking my time lerning vanilla css and possibly moving to either bootstrap or tailwing. At this moment I've chosen a techstack of 
- go  <img src="https://github.com/art3xias23/art3xias23/tree/main/img/golang.ico" alt="test"/>
- [a-h/templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) 
- htmx </> 
- mongodb ![alt text][mongo]

### Future Aims
Some of the things I wish to learn or do in the future are: 

- Go into closure as the brief time I've spent [learning Common Lisp] (https://github.com/art3xias23/clisp-ltk-tutorials) ![alt text][lisp]   has been joyful.
- Go into C as I've been meaning to write an embedded system which would check the current coming in from the electrical network and start a petrol generator when there is no current
- Definitely learn awk, sed, grep and jq as I find them essential and my limited knowledge does not cut it at times.
- As part of the blog I'm planning on studying latex as I've found fun combinations with Latex, snippets and vim which could make blog writing a real joy at first glance
