# art3xias23's Personal Profile

### Intro 

Hiya, in this profile you'll find me following tutorials, experimenting with new languages, frameworks and developing some projects which are of use to me or I'm passionate about.

### Nowadays
Currently I've given myself a goal to grind Leetcode until I feel ready to possibly attempt an interview at a prestiguous company. If that does not happen, I would have still learned algorithm patterns and data structures to a decent amount.
In the (https://github.com/art3xias23/latex-journey)[Latex-Journey] project you will find a Latex document which will be comprised of .NET Interview Questions and a grouping of Data Structures and Algorithms information.

My leetcode profile can be found (https://leetcode.com/u/art3xias/)[here]
I also occasionally use the (https://github.com/art3xias23/leetcode-algos)[Algos) project to test and experiment wth csharp Algo solutions.

### Future Aims
Some of the things I wish to learn or do in the future are: 

- ~~Spend time studying lisp~~
- ~~Spend time studying go~~
- ~~Create a blog in go~~
- Compile a document with all the questions I needed to brush on in csharp during 2024
- Complete all 169 questions on (https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)[Grind 75]
- Go into C as through the Texas C course I found (https://www.edx.org/learn/embedded-systems/the-university-of-texas-at-austin-embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-input-output)[here]
- Go into closure as the brief time I've spent [learning Common Lisp] (https://github.com/art3xias23/clisp-ltk-tutorials) ![alt text][lisp]   has been joyful.
- Definitely learn awk, sed, grep and jq and some Powershell as I find them essential and my limited knowledge does not cut it at times.
