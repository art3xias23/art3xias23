# art3xias23's Personal Profile

### Intro 

Hiya, in this profile you'll find me following tutorials, experimenting with new languages, frameworks and developing some projects which are of use to me or I'm passionate about.

### Nowadays
Currently I've given myself a goal to study system design.

### Future Aims
Some of the things I wish to learn or do in the future are: 

- ~~Spend time studying lisp~~
- ~~Spend time studying go~~
- ~~Create a blog in go~~ [https://github.com/art3xias23/go-blog](https://github.com/art3xias23/go-blog)
- Compile a document with all the questions I needed to brush on in csharp during 2024 (Instead of using latex, should move to obsidian)
- Study system design and use a new language while developing the solutions.
- Definitely learn awk, sed, grep and jq and some Powershell as I find them essential and my limited knowledge does not cut it at times.
- Go into C as through the Texas C course I found [here](https://www.edx.org/learn/embedded-systems/the-university-of-texas-at-austin-embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-input-output)
